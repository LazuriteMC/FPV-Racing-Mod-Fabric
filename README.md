The FPV Racing Mod is a mod which adds flyable FPV drones to Minecraft using the [Fabric Modloader and API](https://fabricmc.net/). It makes
use of several libraries including [Rayon](https://github.com/lazuritemc/rayon), a rigid body simulation library for minecraft, which was
developed with this mod in mind.

### Background
This mod began in late 2018 as a fun side project. Originally, it was just [BlueVista](https://github.com/ethanejohnsons) developing it
on his own whenever he had time. The original codebase was written to work with Forge but was later changed to Fabric due to its ease
of use and other benefits. It wasn't until May 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown that this mod began to take shape, and the first release came
the following September.

The old forge repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ethanejohnsons/FPV-Racing-Mod).
